"""Fail-closed app wiring for the observe-only VC surface.

``main`` calls these to (1) derive the observe runtime config from the app
environment (returning ``None`` — no surface — unless the trusted-workspace
control-plane vars are all set), (2) mount the reads-plus-capture routers, and
(3) derive the per-request ``vc_auth`` from the Databricks Apps forwarded-identity
headers. Everything is fail-closed: without config, ``main`` mounts nothing and
behaves exactly as before (deploy-only validated per the install-path contract).

CUJ-1 (history, capture, in-workspace restore) is native: ``observe_config_from_env``
hardwires it on whenever the control-plane vars resolve, and the space-keyed restore
(``restore_local``, mounted by ``vc_spaces``) is a live OBO write. The GOVERNED
binding-keyed restore (``vc_mutations``) stays fail-closed via ``FailClosedRestore`` —
it can never execute until a real governed-write restore service is wired and
platform-checked. Promotion / optimizer-apply / reconcile are not built here.
