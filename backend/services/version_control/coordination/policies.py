"""Production coordination-authorization policy callbacks.

M03 owns the coordination *mechanism* (`CoordinationService`); it deliberately
takes its authorization decisions as injected callbacks so it never imports M06
policy or M02 identity (the module doc forbids that cycle). Those callbacks
existed only as test mocks — this module supplies the real bindings that M08's
composition (`build_vc_runtime`) wires into the live service.

Each policy is a thin, fail-closed adapter over an already-built durable
service (registry, approvals, facts, coordination store):

* `resolve_binding` / `verify_enrollment` / `insert_enrolled` — enrollment and
  current-binding identity via the M02 registry and the M03 store.
* `validate_authorization` — re-derives the AuthorizationGrant through
  `ApprovalService.authorize` and accepts the candidate only if it is byte-equal,
  so a revoked approval, lapsed membership or expired grant fails closed.
* `verify_create_intent` — confirms the durable request digest matches the
  committed create intent.
* `validate_stage_evidence` — confirms the checkpoint's recorded digest matches
  its committed observation for the same binding revision.

`authorize_heads` and `authorize_human_recovery` gate the reconciliation
(M05) and human-recovery (M03) flows, which are **not** part of the promotion
write path and are not yet platform-integrated; they fail closed so those flows
stay disabled until their owning milestones supply and validate a positive
contract. The promotion gate never advances approved/deployed heads or performs
human recovery, so this does not restrict it.
