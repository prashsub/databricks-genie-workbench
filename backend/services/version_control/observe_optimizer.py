"""Observe a Genie space around an optimizer run (the observe-only pivot core).

The optimizer is self-safe (it rolls back its own non-improving iterations); Version
Control does NOT govern it. It only *records* what the space looked like before the run
and after it settles, so an operator can see the change history and (later) restore.

The ``/trigger`` endpoint calls these best-effort and flag-gated:

* ``capture_before`` — resolve-or-**auto-enroll** the space's binding, then append a
  ``optimizer_before`` observation of the current serialized space.
* ``capture_after_when_complete`` — after the optimizer Job run reaches a terminal
  state, append an ``optimizer_after`` observation stamped with the optimizer ``run_id``
  (the passive path — a UI ``capture_on_open`` — is handled by the observe endpoint).

Everything here is additive and fail-safe: enrollment/capture are writes gated behind
``vc_writes_enabled`` and every call site swallows failures, so VC can never alter or
break optimizer behavior. All Delta writes are validated on deploy, not offline.
